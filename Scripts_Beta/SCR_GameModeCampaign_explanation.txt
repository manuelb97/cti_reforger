### **How the Game Mode Starts and Ensures the World is Fully Initialized**  
The `SCR_GameModeCampaign` class extends `SCR_BaseGameMode`, meaning it follows the **standard game mode initialization process** in Arma Reforger. Below is a breakdown of how it starts and ensures the world is ready.

---

## **üîπ Game Mode Initialization Flow**
### **1. The Game Mode is Created**
- The constructor `SCR_GameModeCampaign(IEntitySource src, IEntity parent)` is called when the game mode entity is spawned.
- It verifies some attributes, registers debug menus (if enabled), and overrides parameters from the mission header.

### **2. `OnWorldPostProcess()` is Called**
```cpp
override void OnWorldPostProcess(World world)
{
    super.OnWorldPostProcess(world);

    if (IsProxy() || !GetGame().InPlayMode())
        return;

    if (m_bAutostart)
        Start();  // ‚úÖ This starts the game mode if autostart is enabled.

    m_bWorldPostProcessDone = true;
}
```
- `OnWorldPostProcess()` is a key event in Enfusion that fires **after the world has finished initializing**.  
- This ensures:
  ‚úÖ The world exists.  
  ‚úÖ All map objects (buildings, roads, assets) are loaded.  
  ‚úÖ It is safe to start game mechanics.  

### **3. The `Start()` Function Runs**
If `m_bAutostart` is enabled, `Start()` is called:
```cpp
protected void Start()
{
    // ‚úÖ Ensures military bases and HQs are properly set up.
    SCR_MilitaryBaseSystem baseManager = SCR_MilitaryBaseSystem.GetInstance();
    if (!baseManager)
        return;

    m_bStarted = true;
    Replication.BumpMe();
    m_BaseManager.OnAllBasesInitialized(); // ‚úÖ Signals that bases are fully initialized.
    OnStarted(); // ‚úÖ Fires an event that the game mode has started.
}
```
- This function ensures that **bases, control points, and HQs are assigned and initialized**.
- After that, `OnStarted()` is called to notify other components that the game mode is ready.

### **4. `OnStarted()` Fires an Event**
```cpp
void OnStarted()
{
    SCR_RadioCoverageSystem coverageSystem = SCR_RadioCoverageSystem.GetInstance();
    if (coverageSystem)
        coverageSystem.TogglePeriodicUpdates(false);

    SCR_SpawnPoint.Event_SpawnPointFactionAssigned.Insert(OnSpawnPointFactionAssigned);

    if (m_OnStarted)
        m_OnStarted.Invoke(); // ‚úÖ Triggers event for other scripts/components.
}
```
- The **game mode is now fully running**.
- Other components (spawning, radio systems, etc.) now react to the game mode's start.

## **üîπ When is the World Fully Initialized?**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **By the time `OnWorldPostProcess()` runs**, the world is initialized and objects are loaded.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **By the time `Start()` completes**, bases and key gameplay elements are initialized.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **If you need buildings/entities, wait for `m_BaseManager.OnAllBasesInitialized()`.**

## **‚úÖ How to Ensure Your Script Runs at the Right Time**
If you need to run `MarkHostileSectors()` **only when the world and entities are fully initialized**, use **one of these approaches**:

### **üìå Option 1: Run in `OnWorldPostProcess()`**
```cpp
override void OnWorldPostProcess(World world)
{
    super.OnWorldPostProcess(world);
    Print("World is fully initialized! Calling MarkHostileSectors...");
    
    GetGame().GetCallqueue().CallLater(MarkHostileSectors, 1000, false); // ‚úÖ Small delay to ensure stability
}
```
üîπ **Best for:** World-level initialization (ensures all objects exist).  

---

### **üìå Option 2: Run After `OnStarted()` Fires**
Modify your component to listen for game mode start:
```cpp
override void OnPostInit(IEntity owner)
{
    super.OnPostInit(owner);
    
    SCR_GameModeCampaign gameMode = SCR_GameModeCampaign.Cast(GetGame().GetGameMode());
    if (!gameMode)
    {
        Print("Game Mode not found!", LogLevel.ERROR);
        return;
    }

    gameMode.GetOnStarted().Insert(MarkHostileSectors); // ‚úÖ Runs only when game mode is ready
}
```
üîπ **Best for:** Ensuring the game mode is running before execution.

---

### **üìå Option 3: Use `OnAllBasesInitialized()` (If You Need Buildings)**
If your script depends on **buildings and bases being ready**, listen for base initialization:
```cpp
override void OnPostInit(IEntity owner)
{
    super.OnPostInit(owner);

    SCR_GameModeCampaign gameMode = SCR_GameModeCampaign.Cast(GetGame().GetGameMode());
    if (!gameMode)
    {
        Print("Game Mode not found!", LogLevel.ERROR);
        return;
    }

    gameMode.GetBaseManager().GetOnAllBasesInitialized().Insert(MarkHostileSectors);
}
```
üîπ **Best for:** Scripts that need bases, control points, or buildings to be fully processed.

---

## **üöÄ Summary**
- ‚úÖ The **world is fully initialized** after `OnWorldPostProcess()`.
- ‚úÖ The **game mode is fully started** after `OnStarted()`.
- ‚úÖ The **bases and control points are ready** after `OnAllBasesInitialized()`.
- ‚úÖ **For most cases, running your script after `OnWorldPostProcess()` is enough.**  
  If you depend on **factions, bases, or control points**, wait for `OnAllBasesInitialized()`.
